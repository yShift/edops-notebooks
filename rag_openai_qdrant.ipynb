        "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI and Qdrant\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the consistency and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a challenge. While these models can understand statistical relationships between words, they often fail to provide accurate factual responses. Because their internal knowledge may not be accurate, outputs can range from spot-on to nonsensical. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework designed to bolster the accuracy of LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases. In this example, we'll demonstrate a streamlined  implementation of the RAG pipeline using only Qdrant and OpenAI SDKs. By harnessing Flag embedding's power, we can bypass additional frameworks' overhead.\n",

              "\"The stack for a web API can vary depending on the specific requirements and technologies used, but a common stack for a web API could include the following components:\\n\\n1. FastAPI: As mentioned in the context, FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.\\n\\n2. NGINX: NGINX can be used as a reverse proxy server to handle incoming requests and distribute them to the appropriate FastAPI instances. NGINX is known for its high performance and can help improve the scalability and reliability of the API.\\n\\n3. Docker: Docker can be utilized to containerize the FastAPI application along with any necessary dependencies. This allows for easy deployment and scalability, as Docker containers can be easily replicated and managed.\\n\\nIn addition to these components, the stack may also include other elements such as a database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing and retrieving data, a cache (e.g. Redis, Memcached) for improving performance, and a message broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) for handling asynchronous communication.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the specific stack will depend on the requirements and constraints of the project, and there may be various alternative technologies and configurations that can be used.\""
